      <p>I let her garden go.<br/>

                let it go, let it go <br/> 

How can I watch the hummingbird <br/>

          I over to sip <br/>

          With its beak's tip <br/>

The purple bee balm—whirring as we heard <br/>

          It years ago? <br/> <br/>


The weeds rise rank and thick <br/>

                let it go, let it go
 <br/>
Where annuals grew and burdock grows, <br/>

         Where standing she <br/>

         At once could see <br/>

The peony, the lily, and the rose <br/>

         Rise over brick <br/> <br/>


She'd laid in patterns. Moss <br/>

              let it go, let it go

Turns the bricks green, softening them <br/>

         By the gray rocks <br/>

         Where hollyhocks <br/>

That lofted while she lived, stem by tall stem, <br/>

         Blossom with loss. <br/>
